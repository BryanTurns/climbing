1. Threadpooling because im pretty sure this is IO bound
2. Indent stdout by one space for each level deeper into the recursion. Can pass depth with the function calls which could also do a check to insure it isn't indenting like 50 times
3. Add a progress bar. Scrape the total number of routes at the top level. Thne count total number of routes and use that for progress bar.
